I'm currently working on a research paper about the detection of hate attacks in YouTube's comment section.

## Work to be performed on each Dataset
* Preprocessing
* Performing VADER Sentiment Analysis
* Finding comment feature values using Perspective API
* Performing LDA Topic Modeling
* Finding word frequency, Bag of Words
* Finding Ngrams (uni, bi, tri)
